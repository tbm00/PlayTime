# PlayTime (fork of fork) 
A spigot plugin that records playtime stats.

Thank you to the original developers; this is a fork of a fork.

## Differences
This was created to fix some data errors I have been experiencing with PlayTime v3.7. To stay updated, it was forked from 852DuartePls's release for 1.20.6 (for which at the time of forking, the pull request had not been accepted). 

#### Changelog
- improved JSON handling and formatting
- fixed some deprecated methods
- reverted most of OlafHammer's 'multiserver support' changes (commit `34747ed69c9c9c0fe7b17cf53a885f41773485d9`)
